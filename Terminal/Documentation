	DOCUMENTATION
	
	This documentation has been revised for version 0.3-x
	
	
	What does it do?
	This script and accompanying Gui will allow easy-to-install raiding functionality to any group base. 
	
	The terminal has the following capabilities and features:
	- End-game Gui to show who won and all player scores with respective teams
	- Raiding progress bar with drop-down stats field
	- Player Banning
	- Control over raiding elements such as total raid time, time to raid a terminal, team colors and your group's team name.
	- Support in filtering enabled games (99% less hax! :D)
	- Auto-Update
	- Super easy to set-up
	- Works in virtually any base design
	
	
	
	Prerequisites for Installation:
	- Ability to modify a configuration script
	- Ability to construct a Union Operation (Commonly called Unions)
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
INSTALLATION --->				Installation (very easy!)
INSTALLATION --->				1.) Place the main script (Cmn65's Raiding Terminal) in game.ServerScriptService
INSTALLATION --->				2.) Place the Gui (Cmn65's Raiding Terminal Gui) in game.StarterGui
INSTALLATION --->				3.) Place your union operation in the location of the base that is to be secured. This is your terminal. 
INSTALLATION --->				4.) Edit the Configuration module. It is important that the following rules are followed:
INSTALLATION --->					- groupId must be greater than or equal to 0. 
INSTALLATION --->					- terminalPart must be a directed location to the terminal object. 
INSTALLATION --->						Ex: If the terminal part is in the Workspace, then the terminalPart variables should equal game.Workspace.TerminalPartNameHere
INSTALLATION --->						- If you are unsure on how to do this then create your union operation and make sure it is directly in game.Workspace. DO NOT model it. Name the part TERMINAL. 
INSTALLATION --->				5.) Done! Have fun raiding!
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Raiding Rules:
	1.) The total riad timer is paused when the raiders control the terminal. It is unpaused when raiders <= defenders in the terminal
	2.) The raiders must have majority control of the terminal for <raidingTime> seconds to win. 
	3.) Capture progress goes dwon when the defenders hold the terminal
	4.) If the defenders hold the terminal without the raiders winning then they win. If the raiders capture the terminal for <raidingTime> then they win. 
	
	Post-Raid:
	1.) All players will have a Gui displayed with all player scores. 
	2.) Respawning after the raid kicks you, new players joining once the raid is over will be kicked automatically. 
	3.) After 10 minutes all players will be kicked, shutting down the server
	
	
	Proper Configuration Tips:
	- Do not make the raidingTime more than the totalTime. This usually results in an unfair advantage to the defenders!
	- Do not make the groupId less than or equal to zero
	- auto-update is a good way to maintain to the most up to date code available. 
	
	
	Important Information:
	- Players that are not defined as a team member for the teams created by the terminal script will NOT be considered a raiding party. Ie: If they aren't on the defending/raiding/ally team then they will not count in the raid
	- The script will work with any team changing. The player will need to leave and re-enter the terminal for the team change to take effect with the terminal
	- Currently admin is NOT supported. Do not worry about this variable in the configuration!
