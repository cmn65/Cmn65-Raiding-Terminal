	Common Errors
	Some erros have been patched, fixed or checked by the script. Some issues may arrise that are not listed here. If that occurs please contact cmn65 on twitter @roblox_cmn65 or PM me!
	
	I really just run into errors while testing and add it here in case someone needs help!
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Often times these problems can occur and may hard to debug for beginners. 
	
	1.   15:33:21.672 - Requested module experienced an error while loading
		 15:33:21.673 - Stack Begin
		 15:33:21.673 - Script 'ServerScriptService.Cmn65's Raiding Terminal', Line 12
		 15:33:21.673 - Stack End
		
		
		This error is due to the Configuration module not loading correctly. 
		Common ways to resolve this are:
		- Making sure no weird lines (especially RED lines) are in the script.
		- terminalPart is directed to a part that does not exist. Make sure this part is in the game or call :WaitForChild() to wait for the terminal to be created
		
		
	2.   15:36:50.335 - StandardPages: Request Failed because HTTP 400 (BadRequest)
		 15:36:50.335 - Stack Begin
		 15:36:50.335 - Script 'ServerScriptService.Cmn65's Raiding Terminal', Line 127
		 15:36:50.335 - Stack End
		
		
		This error is due to misconfiguration in the configuration file. The groupId is invalid. Make sure you have the correct ID. 
		This is not a userId from a player but a groupId found in the URL of the groups page

		Example: https://www.roblox.com/groups/72321/The-First-Encounter-Assault-Recon#!/about     In this URL the number 72321 is the groupId. 
		
		
	3.	 16:24:52.875 - [Cmn65's Raid Terminal V:0.1-1]: [WARNING]: Player File for [cmn65] was not found when indexing!
	
		No player folder was found for the handler usually casued by playing in a solo-test run in Studio. 
		Also caused by the newPlayer() function not seeing a new player joining. 
		
		To resolve this warning the player folder nees to be manually inserted. 
	
	
	
	
	4. Server message pops up saying the terminal broke
	
		This is usually due to the script having corrupted values on variables. To fix this you should allow your terminal to fix itself 
		To do this enable AutoFix in the configuration. The problem should go away. 
		
	
	
	
	
	Known Problems:
	- If you change team while inside the terminal, the script will attempt an auto-fix once the player exits the terminal.
